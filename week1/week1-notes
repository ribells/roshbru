With Rosha on June 17 (for the first week of internship):

We will both set up a Python notebook and try to see how well mediapipe works on static images, using this example:

https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/face_detection.html

We can share results via our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/ribells/roshbru

We can explore the pose services via this pose example notebook:
Pose_Landmarker.ipynb

Bruce will also read and investigate these web page links that Rosha suggested (to focus more on the face):
https://chuoling.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html
https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/blob/master/mediapipe/modules/face_geometry/data/canonical_face_model_uv_visualization.png
