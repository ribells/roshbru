With Rosha on June 17 (for the first week of internship):

We will both set up a Python notebook and try to see how well mediapipe works on static images, using this example:

https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/face_detection.html

We can share results via our GitHub repository:
https://github.com/ribells/roshbru

We can explore the pose services via the pose example:
Pose_Landmarker.ipynb
which is in our week1 GitHub folder

Bruce will also read and investigate any web page links that Rosha sends.
