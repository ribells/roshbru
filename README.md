A 2024 summer internship sharing repository for Rosha and Bruce

Rosha's internship objective:
-----------------------------

I want to use artificial intelligence machine learning to make a program that can process images and generate traced outlines of those images to serve as a starting point to provide artists with a simplified version of the image to trace over and build upon.

This idea was inspired by Harold Cohen’s project AARON, which is one of the earliest AI programs on art making. Here’s a comprehensive article written about him and his project.
